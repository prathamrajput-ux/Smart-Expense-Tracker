<br>
<br>
### Built by Pratham Kumar Singh <br>
*B.Tech AI & Data Science Student* <br><br>

##  Project Overview <br>
This is a lightweight Python application designed to help students manage their daily expenses. It uses core Python logic to store, update, and display spending data. <br><br>

---

## Features <br>
* **Add Expenses:** Input category and amount. <br>
* **Input Validation:** Uses `.isdigit()` to ensure only numbers are entered. <br>
* **Data Storage:** Uses Dictionaries for fast lookups. <br>
* **Summary:** Displays a total breakdown of all spending. <br><br>

##  Technical Stack <br>
**Language:** Python 3.x <br>
**Concepts:** <br>
1. Dictionaries (Key-Value pairs) <br>
2. While & For Loops <br>
3. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) <br>
4. String Manipulation <br><br>

##  Future Vision <br>
As a Data Science student, I plan to scale this project by: <br>
1. Adding **Matplotlib** to visualize spending patterns with graphs. <br>
2. Implementing **Predictive Analysis** to suggest budget cuts. <br>
